Crashes on attempting to enter the campaign. Properties Expanded has since fixed this issue, but it may not be updated. The way to force it to update is to unsubscribe and resubscribe to it.\r\n[*][b][u]Apex Up Your Spawns[/u][/b]: due to being unable to path to the offscreen den, I guess? Either way, not something I can really fix. Crashes on attempting to enter the campaign.\r\n[/list]\r\n",
